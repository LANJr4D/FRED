README file for mod_corba apache module
----------------------------------------

In order to minimize documentation effort and inconsitencies, only one source
of documentation is maintained, which is generated by doxygen. To generate
documentation type "make doc" (assuming you have installed doxygen) and then
you can start browsing web docs at doc/html/index.html.

In documentation generated by doxygen you can find:

  *) General description of mod_corba
  *) Configuration description
  *) Installation guide

If you don't have installed doxygen tools or you don't want to install it,
you can view the raw doxygen source file doc/mainpage.h.
