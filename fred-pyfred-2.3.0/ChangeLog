    * Mailer - add support for IMAP SSL

2011-06-02 Jiri Sadek (2.2.2)

    * Mailer - little tweak to not loose one send period because of penalized
               mail types when no other mail types are ready to send

2011-05-30 Jiri Sadek (2.2.1)

    * Mailer - bugfixed list of attachments

2011-05-23 Jiri Sadek (2.2.0)

    * Mailer - new approach for selecting emails ready to send
             - fixed connection handling in mailNotify method

    * fixing dnssec technical test - new version of ldns drill utility

2009-11-09 Jiri Sadek (2.1.9)

    * Fixed configuration defaults (logging option)

    * Technical tests now notify only newest state (history) of nsset
	  (parallel nsset of different states fix)

    * Fixed email signing procedure - exception type changed

2009-07-09 Jiri Sadek, Tomas Divis (2.1.8)

    * Fixes in mail module to properly update number of attempts (sending
      mails)

    * External processes is now executed with common 'runCommand' method with
      timeout settings

    * Fixes in installation procedure, implemented --no-check-deps for
      disabling of checking dependencies

    * Removed use of _quote() method from pygresql library - due to changes in
      pygresql-4.0

    * Logging system rewritten to support different handlers -
      syslog/file/console (using logging python module)

    * Bugfix in configuration template

2009-07-03 Jiri Sadek (2.1.7)
    * Bugfixes for previous release (last was quite broken)
        - install procedure
		- dnssec test - more error handling

2009-06-24 Jiri Sadek (2.1.6)

    * Test for dnssec key chain of trust added. Test uses drill utility (this
    add new dependency to project)
    Test copy current approach, but changes was needed:
        - __dbGetAssocDomains(...) now return dictionary where key is fqdn of
        domain, value is True/False flag defining if there is a keyset
        associated with domain (we need test only this domains)
        - in database table `check_test' new value (3) is used in need_domain
        column determining that test needs only signed domains on standard
        input

    * New configuration options:
        - drill binary executable
        - trust anchor key file

2009-03-14 Tomas Divis (2.1.5)

    * Bugfix in sending emails from tech check module - it generated invalid 
      corba request because of empty list of email addresses. 

2009-03-26 Tomas Divis (2.1.4)

    * When marking emails as undelivered, response is saved using base64 
      encoding (due to SQL errors when non-utf8 response was delivered).
      Old data must be migrated:
      UPDATE mail_archive SET response = encode(convert_to(response, 'UTF8'),
      'base64')

2009-02-10 Tomas Divis (2.1.3)
	
    * Adding few log messages to debug memory consumtion

2008-11-10 Ales Dolezal (2.1.2)

    * Little fix in installation procedure
	- MANIFEST.in updated

2008-11-08 Jaromir Talir (2.1.1)

    * Renaming 
	- pyfred_server -> fred-pyfred
	- genzone_test -> check_pyfred_genzone

2008-10-19 Jaromir Talir (2.1.0)

    * Adding DS generation from DNSKEY records
	
2008-09-18 Jaromir Talir (2.0.1)

    * Fixing zone generator
	- syntax error
	- DS record generation didn't work

2008-08-14 Jaromir Talir (2.0.0)

    * DNSSEC implementation. Keysets attached to domains are transformed 
      into DS records.
      
    * Zone generation enahncement. Now It's possible to generate zonefile for
      all zones managed by registry. This is now default when no zone is 
      specified either on command line or in config file. New option for 
      genzone_client 'bind_conf' allow generate sample configuration file 
      for bind.
      
    * Default sample configuration file updated to allow mentioned multi 
      zone generation 

2008-07-09 Jaromir Talir (1.9.3)

    * Bugfix in long option handling of filemanager_client

2008-07-09 Jaromir Talir (1.9.2)
          
    * Bugfix in technical checks
      - existence script badly handled names of nonresolvable nameservers
      - mail template for existence had bug in test for techcheck name 

2008-06-20 Jaromir Talir, Ales Dolezal (1.9.0)
	      
    * Refactoring installation process into separate directory freddist

2008-04-18 Ales Dolezal

	* IDL files are now created automatically during
	install step. IDL files are searched in directory which
	location depends on PREFIX variable.

	* Added ability to run setup.py outside its directory.
	Files that setup.py produced (e.g. python bytecode or
	source distribution packages) are stored in current working
	directory.

	* Added some setup command line options (e.g. sysconfdir,
	localstatedir) for better output emplacement of corresponding files.

2008-03-28 Ales Dolezal
		
	* Build step 'build_ild' merged into 'build' step.

	* pyfred.conf is now teplate, modifiable by options
	passed to setup.py during install phase.

2008-02-09 Jaromir Talir (version 1.8.0)
	
        * RPM building, renaming conf files, change package name to
	fred-pyfred

2007-11-07 Jan Kryl (version 1.7.6)

	* Error in techcheck script existence was corrected. Due to the error
	nameservers which could not be resolved triggered unknown result
	instead of error result.

	* Techcheck script existence was improved. Now it performs four
	types of queries in hope that at least one will trigger response
	from server. This gives fairly good results even if we have no domain
	to ask for.

	* Not matched DNS servers in heterogenous technical check were not
	treated well.

	* Technical test recursive4all was corrected to work for cz
	nameservers as well.

	* Basic unittests for techcheck created.

	* Mailer produces non-multipart emails if there are no attachments.

	* Make sure the database schema is upgraded before starting pyfred.
	Column req_domain was renamed to need_domain and its type was changed.

2007-10-10 Jan Kryl (version 1.7.5)

	* Techcheck script recursive4all.py is working even for nic.cz domain
	now.

	* Error in condition in filemanager_client was corrected.

	* Basic unittests for filemanager created.

	* build_idl target of setup.py doesn't generate IDL stubs if they
	are already present.

	* Email addresses of recipients in mailer, which do not contain
	at-sign are silently discarded.

	* Message-ID header in generated emails is saved in database in
	final form. This eliminates problems with incomplete message-id
	or retransmission of same messages with different IDs.

	* To multipart emails is not added extra newline before signing,
	because it breaks signature verification in outlook client.

	* Check undelivered procedure in mailer rewritten from POP3 to IMAP.
	The name of POP3* configuration directives was changed to IMAP*.

	* It is possible to specify IP address where pyfred listens by new
	host configuration directive.

2007-09-30 Jan Kryl (version 1.7.4)

	* File descriptors closing is done better way (before call to wait).
	Credits Ondrej Sury.

	* Techchecks were corrected. The situation when DNS server is not
	responding when domain is not in zone delegated on him was not
	expected.

2007-09-30 Jan Kryl (version 1.7.3)

	* Periodical technical checks may be turned off without affecting
	the out-of-order checks (issued over EPP interface). Usefull for
	testing.

	* Zone generator treated IPv6 address in SOA record as if it was
	IPv4.

	* Bug in heterogenous technical test was fixed (missing import).

	* Typo in techcheck module introduced in previous tag was corrected.

2007-09-29 Ondrej Sury (version 1.7.2)

	* Mailer now closes descriptors when signing emails.

2007-09-29 Ondrej Sury (version 1.7.1)

	* Techcheck now closes descriptors after it's childs

	* Unittests for genzone are ready.

2007-09-26 Jan Kryl (version 1.7.0)

	* Mailer is capable of checking for undelivered email messages.
	It does so by downloading emails over POP3 protocol from mailbox,
	where are accumulated responses for sent emails. If there is a
	response for sent email, the email is marked in database as
	undelivered. The responses are archived as well.

	* Genzone was greatly simplified. It isn't responsible for making
	decision whether domain should be placed in zone or not, based on
	various criteria. Now it simply checks for status 'outzone', which
	is set by another process. As consequence of this the configuration
	directives expiration_hour and safeperiod were cancelled.

	* Few bugs in genzone server were corrected. The zone should now be
	more correctly generated than it was before.

	* New configuration directive "post-hook" for genzone_client was added.
	It runs arbitrary command after successfull zone file generation.
	It is supersedes "rndc" and "reload" configuration directives, which
	were removed.

	* New technical test, which tests requirement for GLUE, was added.
	This test is special, because it is realized directly in techcheck and
	not by external script, and because it influences inputs of all other
	technical tests.

	* When doing technical test, the nameserver's fqdn is not resolved,
	if GLUE is present and should be used. All tests were corrected
	in respect to this.

	* Changes in techcheck associated with new system for poll messages
	archival.

	* Genzone client has new configuration option 'nobackups', which
	disables zone file backups if set to True.

	* New script, not directly related to pyfred, in misc directory added.
	It downloads bank transcripts from IMAP mailbox and via
	filemanager_client stores them as files in database.

	* In some not very often used scripts were set obsoleted import paths.
	This was fixed.

	* New directory unittests was added to repository, but there's nothing
	usable yet.

2007-09-13 Jan Kryl (version 1.6.3)

	* Technical checks are more robust in respect to test script
	freeze-up. Reads are non-blocking and child is killed if it gets
	stuck.

	* Error in all domain-dependant techcheck scripts was corrected.
	The results were interpreted as failure, allthough they shouldn't.

2007-06-14 Jan Kryl (version 1.6.2)

	* Bug in zone generator was fixed. GLUE records were generated
	if the nameserver came from the same zone instead of domain. This
	is wrong behaviour.

	* The order of build targets in setup.py was fixed.

2007-06-13 Jan Kryl (version 1.6.1)

	* When pyfred_server terminates, references registered by corba
	nameservice when pyfred_server was started are deleted.

	* Bug in test for python version in setup.py was fixed.

	* Better handling of unexpected exceptions in pyfred_server (they
	are logged and printed to stderr).

	* The behaviour of genzone client was modified. If there are no
	zones specified on cmd line, the new 'zones' directive from 'general'
	section from config file is taken into account.

	* Critical error in genzone was fixed. The GLUE records were not
	properly generated.

2007-06-11 Jan Kryl (version 1.6.0)

	* Genzone client uses safe method for creating temporary files.

	* It is possible to have individual configuration for each generated
	zone by genzone client.

	* You can specify header and footer files to genzone client. Those
	files will be prepended and appended to zone file, which is convenient
	for comment insertion.

	* pyfred_server creates pid file when it is started. The pidfile is
	named "pyfred.pid" and the directory, where it is created is
	configurable by "piddir" configuration directive.

	* pyfredctl is again functional a can be used for controlling
	pyfred_server. However the pid file must be in default path
	/var/run/pyfred.pid in order to work well.

2007-06-01 Jan Kryl (version 1.5.2)

	* genzone client has new configuration file /etc/fred/genzone.conf.

2007-05-25 Jan Kryl (version 1.5.1)

	* Two bugs in techcheck which disabled generation of poll message
	were fixed (mapping of corba boolean to python's boolean and
	accepting negative check levels as if they would mean default level).

2007-05-20 Jan Kryl (version 1.5.0)

	* New mailer idl function resend was implemented. This function
	triggers sending of an email from email archive.

	* The bug with empty 'To' header was fixed. If 'To' header is empty
	new exception 'InvalidHeader' is thrown.

	* Pyfred server starts now fully daemonized (if run without -d option).
	Daemonization doesn't play very nice with omniorb. In some cases when
	pyfred calls exit, the threads get deadlocked and eat 100% CPU.

	* The pyfred is now installed via setup.py (as it is ussuall in python
	world). This change trigered another one - the reorganization of files
	in repository. The layout of project has completely changed.

	* Whois module is no longer alive, it was removed because it wasn't
	needed in production and there was no time to maintain it.

	* The documentation was rewriten almost from scratch.

2007-04-24 Jan Kryl (version 1.4.3)

	* Critical Bug in pyfred's job scheduler was fixed. The bug
	practically inhibited regularly scheduled jobs.

	* Logic of sending an email in Mailer module was splitted
	in two parts. One part accepts requests and does the templating
	and the other part which is run regularly from pyfred's internal
	job scheduler completes emails and sends them.

	* Manual confirmation of email submission is now available in
	mailer. This may be used for debugging in production.

	* Mailer now tries repeatedly to send email if sendmail fails.
	Maximal number of attempts is configurable by maxattempts
	directive.

2007-04-05 Jan Kryl (version 1.4.2)

	* Postfix adds extra newline after headers when lines terminations
	are mixed together (lf vs. crlf). All lines must have common
	terminator in order for signature to be valid. This was fixed.

2007-04-04 Jan Kryl (version 1.4.1)

	* Signing of emails is done by openssl binary instead of M2Crypto
	library which is not needed anymore. This is a worse solution of
	the signing problem but theres no other way, since outlook doesn't
	like emails signed with M2Crypto.

	* VCard attachment is added to each email. This is kind of a hack to
	overcome bug in outlook, which cannot open multipart email composed
	from just one part.

2007-02-13 Jan Kryl (version 1.4.0)

	* TechCheck module is now able to do regular technical checks of
	all registered nssets.

	* TechCheck has administration interface which is used for searching
	in archive of executed checks.

	* Numerous improvements in check scripts used by techcheck module.

	* Email templates now share the same footer. The footer is not
	duplicated in all templates as it was.

	* pyfred server has its own start/stop/status script called pyfredctl.

	* New attribute 'type' of file is kept about files managed by
	filemanager. Not confuse this new attr 'type' with MIME type,
	which is another attribute of file.

	* Mailer signs all sent emails. Signing is accomplished
	by M2Crypto python library, which is wrapper around openssl library.
	Both theese libraries must be installed when running mailer module.

	* FileManager was modified to transfer files chunk by chunk in
	sequence. The size of chunk is selectable by client. In princip
	for upload or download of a file is created independent CORBA
	object, which handles transfer of data.

	* Documentation is more complete.

2006-11-24 Jan Kryl (version 1.3.0)

	* Over-branding of pyccReg to new name pyfred was done successfully.
	Old name still remains at some places, but those places cannot be
	changed without affecting other parts of registry software.

	* The configuration file is no more shared with central register
	written in C++. Pyfred has now its own configuration file name
	pyfred.conf containing sections for individual modules.

	* Database connection management is done now by pyfred core and
	not by modules, as it was till now.

	* Modules are now able to register jobs (functions) which should
	be run in regular periods. Pyfred core now supports this neat
	feature.

	* New module filemanager was created. Filemanager is capable of
	storing files and loading files. As storage backend is used
	filesystem, some meta information about files is kept in database.

	* New module mailer, used for sending email notifications, was
	created. It depends on clearsilver templating library.

	* Rewrite of genzone module (inspired by new mailer module).
	For each zone transfer is created separate corba object now.

	* The concept of safe-interval was implemented in genzone.
	Additionaly all domains, which should not be generated in zonefile
	first time on that day, are excluded after concrete hour, common
	for all domains.

	* History of inclusion or exclusion of domain in zone is now kept
	in database together with reason of not being included. The status
	is generated by set of complicated SQL statements (credits Jara).

	* Serious bug was fixed in genzone client. For ipv6 addresses
	was not generated record AAAA but same record as for ipv4 addresses.

	* Coding of CORBA strings was explicitly set to UTF-8 in server and
	all clients. Different encodings of two ORB endpoints resulted in
	missinterpretation of national characteres.

	* Configuration file pyfred_modules.conf was removed, since there
	is no reason for it to exist, when we don't share configuration file
	with C++ central register. Modules which should be loaded are now
	specified in pyfred.conf.

	* New modul techcheck for execution of technical checks on nssets
	was created. Scripts realizing individual tests are in subdirectory
	techchecks. In order to be able to run the test scripts, DNS python
	library, fpdns perl script and whois client must be installed
	in the system.

2006-10-20 Jan Kryl (version 1.2.1)

	* The output of genzone client, when running in test mode, was
	modified in order be fulfill expectations of Nagios monitoring tool.

	* pyccReg listens on static port since now, because of better
	ability to do firewalling.

2006-09-27 Jan Kryl (version 1.2.0)

	* This ChangeLog was started in order to keep better overview
	of changes. The ChangeLog serves for whole pyccReg project (server
	and clients, etc.).

	* All files and directories in repository where reorganized in
	better hierarchy. Makefile was completely rewritten.

	* README files where added at places where they were most needed.

	* Database change - the column for ip address of primary nameserver
	in table zone_soa was removed. Primary nameserver data are now
	maintained together with other nameservers in table zone_ns.
